Collection:
40 mL of UT7/EPO growing cells at 5 x 10^3 cells/mL were collected.
Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells fixed with 2 mL of 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS, 4% PFA for 10 min at RT.
Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells were stored at 4°C in 2mL 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS until staining.

Staining:
On staining day 3 x 10^6 cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells were permeabilized with 600μL of 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 15 min at RT.
Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells were stained with 300μL 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% FBS for 1 H at 20°C with:
- DAPI (dil 1/5000 from 1mg/mL, #A4099,0005, PanReac AppliChem)
- anti phospho Histone H3 directly coupled with AF647 (dil 1/50, #650806, Biolegend)
- anti phospho alpha Tubulin directly coupled with PE (dil 1/500, #ab208752, abcam)
- anti ARK2 directly coupled with AF488 (dil 1/50, #sc393357, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells were washed with 300μL 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS.
Cells were centrifuged 5 min at 300g RT and supernatant discarded.
Cells were resupended with 105μL 0Ca++, 0Mg++ PBS.

For compensation:
Mono stained cells were prepared with 1 x 10^6 cells and the above staining volume divided by 3

For acquistion:
Cells were acquired on staining day on ISX MkII© with INSPIRE® (200.1.620.0),
Magnification at 40x,
BF on channel 04 and DF on channel 06,
375: 10.80; 488: 50.00; 642: 150.00; 785: 1.00,
375 was adjuted to get G1 peak around 2 x 10e5 a.u.
