IFCdata contains 4 example files:
_inst/extdata/example.rif
It is a 'raw image file' which is a merged of manually identified objects
exported from IDEAS® (6.2.183.0) to illustrate cell cycle (see inst/staining).
This merged file is composed of:
-40 cells corresponding to G1 phase,
-40 cells corresponding to  S phase,
-40 cells corresponding to G2 phase,
-40 cells corresponding to prophase,
-40 cells corresponding to metaphase,
-40 cells corresponding to anaphase,
-40 cells corresponding to telophase,
-40 cells corresponding to late telophase,
-40 cells with 2 tubulin aggregated strutures,
-40 cells with monopolar aggregated tubulin in the center of chromosomal aster,
-10 dead cells,
-10 clippled objects

_inst/extdata/example.cif
It is a 'compensated image file' which as been generated from example.rif
with IDEAS® (6.0.354.0). Compensation was computed with monostained controls
(see inst/staining)

_inst/extdata/example_6.0.daf
It is a 'data analysis file' which as been generated with IDEAS® (6.0.354.0)

_inst/extdata/example.daf
It is a 'data analysis file'. It corresponds to example_6.0.daf opened with
IDEAS® (6.2.183.0) and saved as example.daf
